## F27 Ventures

F27 was started by a group of 27-year olds who wanted to change the world one code commit at a time. We've worked with startups, large corporates and gone freelance too. You don't have to be 27 to be part of our journey. Collaborators and supporters are very welcome.

We are focused on the intersection of three emergent, fast-growing trends:
1. The export of China's culture, technological innovation and wealth - simply known as the Chinese diaspora
2. The shift in economics that Blockchain / Cryptocurrency will bring to financial and general markets
3. The long term rise of Freelance as not just a side profession but as a main gig for more and more of world's population

# Our Current Bets

In line with our hypothesis, we are currently focusing heavily on the following areas:
1. NEO Blockchain - NEO is a very promising open-source blockchain technology that began in China (1), covers cryptocurrency and smart economy as a platform (2) and is empowering a new generation of freelance developers and contributors (3). We are excited about the potential of NEO as a long term replacement for Ethereum, EOS as the leading smart economy blockchain.
2. Startup investments catering to both Chinese diaspora and freelancers. We have a currently very limited fund for this purpose. If you would like to know more information please send a message to sharon.chan@f27.ventures.
3. Marketplace Data Science Software - there is very little open source software available to marketplace businesses especially in the early stages when they don't have a data science team. We are working on some tools, the first one is called cohorts, but will extend to a data platform that should be very useful to the operational team as well as during the fund-raising process.
